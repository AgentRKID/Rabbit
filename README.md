## Rabbit
Rabbit is an open source server data manager with the main purpose of allowing developers to access data from across their network

### Features
* Flexible API
* Server Metadata system
* Bukkit network player connection events
* Session based metadata (Metadata transfers across server)

#### Comments
Usually an API wouldn't be provided, but since this is open source I've created one, usually I would just get what I need normally.

### Compiling
As most people won't have paper downloaded, you must download it or CraftBukkit to use it, or even use your own spigot.
```xml
mvn package
```

### Usage
If you use this/fork it please all i ask for is credit, if you're using it on your network and having trouble message me on discord @ rkid#0001 

### Requirements
Redis - (Any version)
