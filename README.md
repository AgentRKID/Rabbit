## Rabbit

## Archived
This has been archived, it was intended as an open source plugin, i lost motivation after working on other things, this was created in around 1-2 days, alot of the features are very unique but not the best, it most definally could be better but i never felt like updating it again, the redis system is alright but still not as good as i would hope.

I Recommend not using, this has been tested to not have any performance issues, but in general the code base is bad, you can always still use it but i won't be providing support for it.

### Info
Rabbit is an open source server data manager with the main purpose of allowing developers to access data from across their network

### Features
* Flexible API
* Server Metadata system
* Bukkit network player connection events
* Session based metadata (Metadata transfers across server)

#### Comments
Usually an API wouldn't be provided, but since this is open source I've created one, usually I would just get what I need normally.

### Compiling
As most people won't have paper downloaded, you must download it or CraftBukkit to use it, or even use your own spigot.
```xml
mvn package
```

### Usage
If you use this/fork it please all i ask for is credit, if you're using it on your network and having trouble message me on discord @ rkid#0001 

### Requirements
Redis - (Any version)
